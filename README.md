# Horses-or-humans
this project is a simple Tensorflow project on binary classification between horses and humans using TensorFlow and CNNs.

I created it to receive input data from an external file that contains pictures of humans and horses using convolution networks and custom model design. the app allows you to test the algorithm by entering a URL of an image into the terminal and it will output whether the picture is of a human or a horse.
